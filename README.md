<p id="description">It is a game that is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock paper and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal it is considered a tie and play resumes until there is a clear winner.</p>

<p> The purpose of making this is to test my knowledge in JS and building custom UI from scratch.</p>
